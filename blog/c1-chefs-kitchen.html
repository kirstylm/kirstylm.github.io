        <h3>Based on the video, what's your take on the EDA experience? What is your impression of EDA? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I agree with the comming into this course with the right attitude, and like the idea of everyone helping eachother. I agreed with what was said about the best way to get the most of the course is to take control of your own learning experience, asthis industry is not going to work for you if you enjoy your learning served on a plate. I know we will need to continue learning and teaching ourselves everyday for the rest of our career to keep up in this industry.</p>

          <p>I think I will enjoy the type of culture at EDA, but I am very used to teaching myself and working by myself, so I may struggle with peer programming at first. I can also be a bit shy with meeting new people/making new friends.In terms of fears I might struggle at first in phase 0 to stay motivated as I already know html and css, but as we progress through to intermediate javascript and rails, I know it will be a lot of hard work and i'll be doing my absolute best to attempt to keep up with the class because as much as I love programming, I don't believe it comes naturally to me at all.
