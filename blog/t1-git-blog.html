        <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
        <p>
Version control enables you to keep track of your project throughout it's lifecyle. You have a master version of your project and are able to revert back to an older version if need be easily if something breaks or needs to be undone. You can also use it to collaberate with others on the same project. It will help you keep track of all the differnt pieces of code being merged in from different people. What happens is when you have a task to you, you will create a branch (copy) of the master version of the project and then when you have finished your work on your local branch, merge it back into the master copy. Version control keeps track of this merge with your changes, and will let you know if any work you have done conflicts with someone elses verion of the code that they haved added to the project (since you branched of master, or last pulled the latest updates from master). It will allow you to see the differences between your code, and choose who's version you would like to keep.
        </p>
        <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
        You keep track of changes by creating a new branch every time you have a new task to do. When you have finished with your task you commit it and add a message to explain what you have changed. git keeps track of every commit with its' message, and inside every commit you can see the code changes.

        <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
        It is a good way to collaberate with other people on a project no matter where they are in the world. GitHub stores your project, and is the central place from where others on your project can get a copy of the code from and if they have persmission, contribute to it.
